## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

- How to center a card using Flexbox both vertically and horizontally
- The importance of using semantic HTML tags like `<section>` and `<main>` for accessibility
- How mobile-first design makes layout easier when scaling up

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
}
```

### Continued development

- I'd like to get more confident using Grid for more complex layouts
- I want to learn how to make this kind of layout responsive without hard-coded sizes
- Iâ€™d like to practice more with Styled Components in React on small UI components
